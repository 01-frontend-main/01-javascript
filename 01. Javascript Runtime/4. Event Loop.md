## Event Loop

- Event loop `ensures` that the `code executes in a non-blocking manner` by processing the callback queue and `executing functions` once the `call stack is empty`
- It `continuously checks` if the `call stack is empty`. If there are `any functions waiting to be executed` in the callback queue or other task queues
