## JavaScript Engine

- A program that `compiles and executes JavaScript code`. It takes the JavaScript code and processes it, converting it into `machine code or bytecode`

## Components of a JavaScript Engine

- `Parser`
  . Translates the `raw JavaScript code` into an `Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)`

- `Interpreter`
  . Directly `executes the AST`. Early JavaScript engines would mostly rely on interpretation, which could be slow.

- `Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler`
  . A `crucial optimization tool` that translates JavaScript code `into machine code` right before it's executed

- `Garbage Collector`
  . An automatic memory management system that periodically `frees up memory` that is `no longer in use`
