## Web APIs

- When JavaScript is `running in a browser`, it `has access` to various Web APIs provided by the browser
- Web APIs includes
  . DOM (Document Object Model)
  . Fetch API
  . setTimeout/setInterval
  . ...
- These APIs are `not part of the JavaScript language` but are `part of the browser runtime environment`
