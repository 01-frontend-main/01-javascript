# What is Javascript Engine?

Javascript is `a single threaded language`. This means it has `one call stack` and `one memory heap`. Therefore, Javascript need an engine to execute and `handles concurrency`

The Javascript engine is a computer program that `parses and executes` the JavaScript code

Types of Javascript engines

- V8 (Chrome, Node.js)
- SpiderMonkey (Firefox)
- JavaScriptCore (Safari)
- Chakra (Legacy Edge)

The JavaScript engines are `embedded in JavaScript runtime environments` such as

- Browsers
- Node.js
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

# How does the Javascript engine work?

In modern engines, `the Interpreter starts reading the code line by line` while `the Profiler watches for frequently used code and flags` then `passes is to the Compiler to be optimized`

In the end, the JavaScript engine `takes the bytecode from the Interpreter outputs` and `mixes in the optimized code the Compiler outputs` and then gives that to the computer. This is called `Just in Time or JIT Compiler`

## 1. Parser

The Parser starts by `reading the code line by line`, `checking it for errors`, and `decodes the code contents into tokens` which can be used for create the `Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)`

## 2. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

These token `will get formed in a tree` called Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

## 3. Interpreter

_Refer 3. interpreter, compiler and JIT.md_

## 4. Compiler

_Refer 3. interpreter, compiler and JIT.md_

## 5. Optimized code

The optimized code can be run more efficiency and faster
